Hi! I am currently a last-year MSc Student in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence at [NOVA School of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt/), NOVA University Lisbon, Portugal. 

I am working as a Research Intern at the [NOVA LINCS](https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/) research lab.

<!-- , where I am fortunate to have João Leite as my supervisor. -->

My primary research interests span Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Knowledge Representation, including:
- Explainable AI (XAI) and Neurosymbolic AI
- Mechanistic interpretability (e.g. concept probing)
- Causal representation learning
- Fairness in machine learning
